# nexus_solver
 A useful tool for NexusGrief server.

 This script uses latest.log file to read the chat on the NexusGrief server. When it finds a mathematical task to solve, it sends the answer to the chat using the keyboard emulation (it presses 't', then types the answer, then presses 'enter').
 The delay is included to give you time to move your hands away from the keyboard, otherwise the answer like "95w"/"s95" (WASD keys) may be sent. You will hear a sound as soon as the script finds a task to solve.

 By the way, I'm planning to write the AntiAFK script for NexusGrief.
